                        <p><q>Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact, and that is - everything around you that you call life, was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. <br><br> The minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will, you know, if you push it in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can maybe mold it. That's the most important thing. It's to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you're just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it. <br><br> I think that's very important and however you learn that, once you learn it, you'll want to change life and make it better, cause it's kind of messed up, in a lot of ways. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.</q>  <br><br> -Steve Jobs</p>
